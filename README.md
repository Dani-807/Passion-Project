# 🎵 DYING RHYTHMS – A Rhythm Game Made with Godot

Welcome to **Dying Rhythms**, a rhythm-based music game created as part of a computer science assignment where the only rule was: **"make something you're passionate about."**

This game is the result of combining two things I love: **music** and **games**.

## 🌱 Origin Story

At the start of this project, my computer science teacher introduced us to a video that featured **Sonic Pi** — a live coding music tool. That was the moment something clicked: I could mix my interest in music with coding.

I began with a big dream: an **action game** with **custom-drawn sprites**, intense beat-based gameplay, and maybe even music made in Sonic Pi. But I quickly realized that drawing all my assets and coding advanced mechanics was too much for the time I had.

So I pivoted — back to what truly excited me: **rhythm games**. I decided to focus on the coding and core gameplay, learning how to sync falling keys to beats and measure timing accuracy.

## 🎮 Gameplay

**Passion Project** is a rhythm game where arrows fall from the top of the screen in sync with music. The player must press the correct keys as they pass a specific point to score:

* **Perfect**
* **Great**
* **Good**
* **OK**
* or **Miss** if mistimed

Each timing gives a different score and affects the combo multiplier. Visual feedback and animated effects help the player improve their rhythm.

## 🥉 Features

* Built with the **Godot Engine**
* Custom signal system for decoupled game logic
* Timing accuracy grading (Perfect to Miss)
* Combo tracking
* Score system
* Randomized and pre-scripted beat spawning
* Stylized feedback (score text, glow effect)
* Currently experimenting with integration ideas for **Sonic Pi**

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key                | Action                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `A`, `W`, `S`, `D` | Hit corresponding falling keys |

## 💡 Inspirations

* The tutorial by **Luera** was a major guide and reference point. I adapted and extended its logic for my own version.
* Games like **Dance Dance Revolution**, **Friday Night Funkin’**, and **osu!** were inspirational for core mechanics.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

* Godot’s signal system is awesome (and sometimes confusing)
* Custom timers and beat sync require real math
* Procrastination is my final boss
* Sometimes simplifying your idea actually helps you **finish** it

---

## 🚪 Future Plans

* Add actual songs and beatmaps
* Integrate Sonic Pi for live-coded music generation
* Improve visuals and polish
* Add a main menu, difficulty levels, and more lanes

## ❤️ Final Thought

> I didn’t finish what I *thought* I wanted to make.
>
> But I made the thing I *actually* wanted to try — and I’m proud of that.
